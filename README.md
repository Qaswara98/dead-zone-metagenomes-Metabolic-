# Dead Zone Metagenomes

**Metabolic Roles of Uncultivated Bacterioplankton Lineages in the Northern Gulf of Mexico “Dead Zone”**  
_A project based on the dataset and findings from Thrash et al. (2017)_

---

## Project Overview

This project investigates the metabolic roles of uncultivated bacterioplankton lineages inhabiting the hypoxic "dead zone" of the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM). Using a subset of the original metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data from Thrash et al. (2017), we reconstruct microbial genomes and analyze their gene expression to understand their contributions to nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon cycling.

## Objectives

- Assemble metagenomes from nGOM water column samples
- Bin and annotate genomes of uncultivated microbial taxa
- Map RNA reads to assess gene expression and activity
- Reconstruct metabolic pathways and compare across lineages
